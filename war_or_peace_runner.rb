# Create 52 Cards (A standard deck)
# Put those card into two Decks (some randomness would be nice here!)
# Create two players with the Decks you created
# Start the game using a new method called start
# This method will need to be included in a class - it is up to you which class to include it in - either existing or ✨new ✨
# Keep in mind that your existing objects should still pass all existing tests - nothing that you add in this iteration should break anything that functioned in iterations 1 or 2!

#
# Welcome to War! (or Peace) This game will be played with 52 cards.
# The players today are Megan and Aurora.
# Type 'GO' to start the game!
